# Coverage Converter
This Task converts .coverage file into .coveragexml. 

The .coverage file is generated by vsTest.exe or VSTest@2(Azure DevOps)

## Motivation:
- I created this extension to help my pipeline process.
- Instead building a script I rather share the same code with everyone, so people don't need to waste their time searching for things that should be straight forward.
- Learn some new stuff like AzureDevOps Tasks and a bit of Node


## Things to keep in mind
- We can't use Coverage.exe to generate .coverage file
 -- link: https://github.com/microsoft/vstest/issues/1502

- :broken_heart: We can't use VSTest@2 Task with codeCoverageEnabled as true
 -- If we enabled it, this will add a file into Code Coverage tab in Azure DevOps, which will override the ReportGenerator reports.
 -- This is not because this tool, it is because VSTest@2 upload it automatically and we can't disable it.
 -- If they didn't do that we could use the coverage file generated by the VSTest@2


## How to setup this pipeline?

You can check this here:
https://github.com/Rogeriohsjr/TestWebApp/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml

Basically we have.

- Execute VSTest@2 to upload Tests to Azure DevOps
- Execute CoverageConverter@0 to generate the DynamicCodeCoverage.coveragexml
- Execute reportgenerator@4 to generate the Reports from DynamicCodeCoverage.coveragexml generated above
- Execute PublishCodeCoverageResults@1 to post the Result from reportgenerator@4


## How does the convertion works?

Take a look in the code, I tried to comment the code to make that easier to understand. It is all in one file.
